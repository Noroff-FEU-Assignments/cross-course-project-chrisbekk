    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
    I would emphasize four principles of web security for the client to focus on.
    
    <ol>
        <li>Secure Authorization and Authentication</li>
        <p>This involves using strong login passwords for their users, but also the use of authentication technology; this is best achieved through the adoption of a third-party provider, such as OneLogin.</p>

        <li>Network Security</li>
        <p>Ensuring that the clientâ€™s local network is secure and avoids single points of failure. The network should be designed and installed by a network engineer. If the client adopts a third-party hosting platform, security should be emphasized in choosing a provider.</p>

        <li>Encryption of user data</li>
        <p>Treat all data between the website and web browsers as a potential security threat. Use HTML and SQL sanitization libraries in order to ensure that the data only includes tags that are regarded as safe. Additionally, the web server should be configured to use HTTPS and HSTS protocols. This ensures that the data sent between client and server is encrypted, and that cookies, POST requests and header information are not easily available to attackers. </p>

        <li>Adopt a cybersecurity mindset</li>
        <p>Your website represents a valuable asset for your business, but for the outside world it is also a representation of your brand. An attack on your site could lead to loss of business transactions, and it might also lead to the public not trusting your services or you as a business partner. Protecting the website from threats should therefore be a priority for everyone involved in the organization, and not only the cybersecurity team. </p>
    </ol>
